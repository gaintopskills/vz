  I’m not another biohacker chasing quick performance boosts with overstimulation and supplement megadosing. Yes, I use strategic tools, but my approach is different.</p>

<p>I’m designing a longevity protocol by asking a deeper question: what does my body need to act young again, according to its genetic blueprint — the true fountain of youth within us?</p>

<p>Instead of endlessly topping off with pills, peptides, or IV drips, I focus on restoring the body’s own ability to make NAD+, copper peptides, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and the thousands of molecules that define youth.</p>

<p>Like other biohackers, I’m chasing youth. But unlike most, my aim is not optimization — it’s rejuvenation: complete DNA and cellular reset back to biological age 20.</p>

<p>I am designing my longevity protocole without numerouse doctors, expensive procedures, sharing my protocols, and building a system that works synergistically — not just one hack or even a hundred hacks, but a lifestyle that reprograms genes to express youth. After only two months of commitment, I already saw and felt real change. It inspired me and propelled me into sharing my journey.</p>

<p>They say aim for the stars and you might land on the moon. For me, this journey is exactly that — an exploration of what’s possible. And I want to share it openly, to inspire others to take control of their health and realize just how much power we truly have.

  <!-- What Makes My Approach Different -->
  <section id="approach">
    <h2>What Makes My Approach Different</h2>
    <p><strong>Most biohackers</strong> focus on quick wins — peptides, one-off supplements, or tech gadgets.<br />
    <strong>My philosophy</strong> is systemic:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🧬 <strong>DNA Methylation Reset</strong> → foods and nutrients that rewrite how genes express.</li>
      <li>💧 <strong>True Hydration</strong> → structured water + minerals to restore the extracellular matrix.</li>
      <li>♻️ <strong>Detoxification & Enzyme Therapy</strong> → clearing fibrosis, glycation, heavy metals, and cellular “rust.”</li>
      <li>🌞 <strong>Natural Rhythms</strong> → sleep, light therapy, and sun exposure, not just artificial hacks.</li>
      <li>🏃 <strong>Movement & Flow</strong> → strength, daily hiking, circulation for stem cell activation.</li>
      <li>⚡ <strong>Synergy Over Isolation</strong> → nothing in my protocol works alone. Every element is designed to amplify the others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’m not just slowing aging — I’m actively <strong>remodeling my tissues, mitochondria, and hormones</strong> back toward youth.</p>
