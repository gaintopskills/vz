<p>I’m not another biohacker chasing quick performance boosts through overstimulation and megadosing. Yes, I use strategic tools, but my approach is different.</p>

<p>I’m creating a longevity protocol by asking a deeper question: what does my body truly need to act young again, according to its genetic blueprint — the real fountain of youth within us?</p>

<p>Instead of endlessly topping off with pills, peptides, or IV drips, I focus on restoring the body’s natural ability to produce its own NAD+, copper peptides, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and the thousands of molecules that define youth.</p>

<p>Like other biohackers, I’m chasing youth. But unlike most, my aim isn’t just optimization — it’s rejuvenation: a complete DNA and cellular reset back to biological age 20.</p>

<p>I’m doing this without an army of doctors or costly procedures. I’m building my protocol step by step, sharing everything openly, and designing a system that works synergistically — not just one hack or even a hundred hacks, but a lifestyle that reprograms genes to express youth. After only two months of full commitment, I’ve already seen and felt profound changes. That alone was enough to ignite my mission and propel me to share my journey.</p>

<p>They say aim for the stars and you might land on the moon. For me, this journey is exactly that — an exploration of what’s possible. And I want to share it openly, to inspire others to take control of their health and discover how much power we truly have.</p>

  <!-- What Makes My Approach Different -->
  <section id="approach">
    <h2>What I am Working On</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Supplying Raw Materials</h3>
      <p>
        Not megadosing — but correcting deep deficiencies with precision. Giving the body the
        building blocks it knows how to use so it can rebuild its own collagen, hyaluronic acid,
        NAD+, copper peptides, and other youth molecules.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Epigenetic Reprogramming</h3>
      <p>
        Resetting the blueprint by silencing aging pathways (including viral remnants embedded in
        our DNA) and reactivating youth genes through methylation, food signals, and environment.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Restoring Production Capacity</h3>
      <p>
        Not outsourcing molecules endlessly via supplements and IVs — but reminding the body how to
        make them again on its own, as it did at 20.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Systemic Detoxification</h3>
      <p>
        Clearing fibrosis, glycation, plastics, and heavy metals. Unblocking receptors and
        restoring nutrient sensing so that youthful signals can be heard again.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Matrix Repair &amp; Hydration</h3>
      <p>
        Rebuilding the extracellular matrix — the <em>soil</em> cells live in. Restoring structure
        and hydration with minerals, structured water, and ECM repair so signals and nutrients flow
        freely.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Energy &amp; Biological Rhythms</h3>
      <p>
        Rejuvenating mitochondria through fasting, natural light and dark cycles, deep sleep, and
        circadian alignment. This is how energy and repair pathways are switched back on.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Deep Resets</h3>
      <p>
        Occasional water fasting as a “reset button” to clear debris, recycle damaged cells, and
        push the body back into repair mode.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Synergy Over Isolation</h3>
      <p>
        It’s the orchestra, not the solo. No single intervention is enough. Nutrient repletion
        without detox is incomplete. Collagen production without ECM repair is short-lived. DNA
        methylation fixes without clearing toxins can’t fully signal youth. True rejuvenation
        requires synergy — each element amplifying the others into a systemic reset.
      </p>
