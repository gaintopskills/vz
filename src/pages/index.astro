<p>I’m not another biohacker chasing quick performance boosts through overstimulation and megadosing. Yes, I use strategic tools, but my approach is different.</p>

<p>I’m creating a longevity protocol by asking a deeper question: what does my body truly need to act young again, according to its genetic blueprint — the real fountain of youth within us?</p>

<p>Instead of endlessly topping off with pills, peptides, or IV drips, I focus on restoring the body’s natural ability to produce its own NAD+, copper peptides, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and the thousands of molecules that define youth.</p>

<p>Like other biohackers, I’m chasing youth. But unlike most, my aim isn’t just optimization — it’s rejuvenation: a complete DNA and cellular reset back to biological age 20.</p>

<p>I’m doing this without an army of doctors or costly procedures. I’m building my protocol step by step, sharing everything openly, and designing a system that works synergistically — not just one hack or even a hundred hacks, but a lifestyle that reprograms genes to express youth. After only two months of full commitment, I’ve already seen and felt profound changes. That alone was enough to ignite my mission and propel me to share my journey.</p>

<p>They say aim for the stars and you might land on the moon. For me, this journey is exactly that — an exploration of what’s possible. And I want to share it openly, to inspire others to take control of their health and discover how much power we truly have.</p>

  <!-- What Makes My Approach Different -->
  <section id="approach">
    <h2>What Makes My Approach Different</h2>
    <p><strong>Most biohackers</strong> focus on quick wins — peptides, one-off supplements, or tech gadgets.<br />
    <strong>My philosophy</strong> is systemic:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🧬 <strong>DNA Methylation Reset</strong> → foods and nutrients that rewrite how genes express.</li>
      <li>💧 <strong>True Hydration</strong> → structured water + minerals to restore the extracellular matrix.</li>
      <li>♻️ <strong>Detoxification & Enzyme Therapy</strong> → clearing fibrosis, glycation, heavy metals, and cellular “rust.”</li>
      <li>🌞 <strong>Natural Rhythms</strong> → sleep, light therapy, and sun exposure, not just artificial hacks.</li>
      <li>🏃 <strong>Movement & Flow</strong> → strength, daily hiking, circulation for stem cell activation.</li>
      <li>⚡ <strong>Synergy Over Isolation</strong> → nothing in my protocol works alone. Every element is designed to amplify the others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’m not just slowing aging — I’m actively <strong>remodeling my tissues, mitochondria, and hormones</strong> back toward youth.</p>
