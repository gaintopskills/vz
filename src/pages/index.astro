  I am not another so-called biohacker chasing performance — tricking the body into temporary boosts of focus, sleep, or productivity through overstimulation and supplement megadosing. My approach is different: I’m designing longevity by asking a deeper question — <strong>what does my body and mind need to act younger according to their genetic blueprint?</strong> What does my biology need to restore its own NAD+, copper peptides, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and the thousands of other molecules that define youth — instead of endlessly shoving fragments of them back in through pills, peptides, and IV drips? 
</p>

<p>
  Like others, I am chasing youth. But unlike most, I believe it’s truly possible — with today’s science, self-experimentation, and the accelerating power of AI. For me, this is not about optimization; it’s about <strong>a return to biological youth</strong> — complete DNA and cellular rejuvenation back to age 20.
</p>

<p>
  I’m documenting every step of this journey, sharing the protocols, and building a system that works synergistically — not just one hack or supplement, but a lifestyle designed to reprogram the way my genes express youth. I may not succeed, but I am determined to try to put this puzzle together. In just two months of fully committing, I’ve already begun to see and feel changes — and that alone is inspiring. It makes me ask: <strong>just how far can we actually go?</strong> 
</p>

<p>
  They say aim for the stars and you might land on the moon. For me, this is exactly that kind of journey — an exploration of what’s possible. And I want to share it openly, to inspire others to take control of their health and realize just how much power we truly have.

  <!-- What Makes My Approach Different -->
  <section id="approach">
    <h2>What Makes My Approach Different</h2>
    <p><strong>Most biohackers</strong> focus on quick wins — peptides, one-off supplements, or tech gadgets.<br />
    <strong>My philosophy</strong> is systemic:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🧬 <strong>DNA Methylation Reset</strong> → foods and nutrients that rewrite how genes express.</li>
      <li>💧 <strong>True Hydration</strong> → structured water + minerals to restore the extracellular matrix.</li>
      <li>♻️ <strong>Detoxification & Enzyme Therapy</strong> → clearing fibrosis, glycation, heavy metals, and cellular “rust.”</li>
      <li>🌞 <strong>Natural Rhythms</strong> → sleep, light therapy, and sun exposure, not just artificial hacks.</li>
      <li>🏃 <strong>Movement & Flow</strong> → strength, daily hiking, circulation for stem cell activation.</li>
      <li>⚡ <strong>Synergy Over Isolation</strong> → nothing in my protocol works alone. Every element is designed to amplify the others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’m not just slowing aging — I’m actively <strong>remodeling my tissues, mitochondria, and hormones</strong> back toward youth.</p>
